# .dotfiles

  + These files are to be sym-linked into their correct locations,
    mostly the home directory.

  + Those with additional extensions, like `.remote` are
    to be used in containers. They use colour, for example, to
    avoid confusion over which machine is being accessed.

  + Note that `.vimrc` is not here, as it is in a separate
    `.vim` repository.
